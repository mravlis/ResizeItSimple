	Specifies the Pixel Offset Mode for image transformations.
	
		Bicubic: Specifies bicubic interpolation. No prefiltering is done. This mode is not suitable for shrinking an image below 25 percent of its original size.
		Bilinear: Specifies bilinear interpolation. No prefiltering is done. This mode is not suitable for shrinking an image below 50 percent of its original size.
		Default: Specifies default mode.
		High: Specifies high quality interpolation.
		HighQualityBicubic: Specifies high-quality, bicubic interpolation. Prefiltering is performed to ensure high-quality shrinking. This mode produces the highest quality transformed images.
		HighQualityBilinear: Specifies high-quality, bilinear interpolation. Prefiltering is performed to ensure high-quality shrinking.
		Invalid: Equivalent to the Invalid element of the QualityMode enumeration.
		Low: Specifies low quality interpolation.
		NearestNeighbor: Specifies nearest-neighbor interpolation.
